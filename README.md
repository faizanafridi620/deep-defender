# DeepDefender

 DeepDefender is an advanced malware detection platform powered by machine learning. Our mission is to
 provide comprehensive protection against digital threats by leveraging cutting-edge technology to scan
 files, URLs, and more.

 ## Features

- 🧠 **Machine Learning Integration** – Uses a trained ML model for intelligent analysis or predictions
- 🔒 **JWT Authentication** – Secure login and token-based access
- 🗄️ **MongoDB & Mongoose** – Database and schema modeling for user and app data
- 🎨 **UI Frameworks** – Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, and modular component libraries
- 📊 **Data Visualization** – Charts with Recharts
- 🧩 **Component Toolkit** – Built using `cmdk`, `vaul`, and other Radix-based components
- 🧠 **Advanced Inputs** – OTP forms, dialogs, switchers, sliders, etc.
- ✅ **Form Handling** – Validated with React Hook Form and Zod
- 🔁 **React Hooks** – State and effects throughout the app

## 🧠 ML Functionality

The core logic includes an ML model (e.g., for detection/classification), which is:
- Loaded and run from the backend (via Node.js + Mongoose)
- Connected to frontend actions such as form submission or UI triggers
- Can be expanded to use TensorFlow.js, ONNX, or Python-based APIs
